                        <h3>Unreal Multiplayer C++ Project</h3>
                        <p> During the fall of 2023 and my last semester at RIT in the spring of 2024, I would spend a majority of my free time working on a multiplayer template project that was primarily C++ in Unreal Engine. The project has taught me how sessions are implemented in Unreal's C++ library and has allowed me to improve my understanding of system replication. Moving forward, I have also decided that I would make all my projects open source since it would allow people to not needlessly spend time on finding solutions for particular issues in C++ Unreal. </p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>Current project progress: </p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>●	Users can host sessions, defined the lobby size, and whether this session is LAN. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	Users can browse all available sessions and see if the lobbies are full and what user is hosting that particular session. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	When in the same sessions, users are able to travel to the main "game" using Q, traveling all clients to a new level. This new level has boxes the have UI pop-ups that only appear for that particular client and there is a basic melee combat system to demonstrate basic replication. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	Beyond the multiplayer aspects, that project has the systems developed for language localization, graphics settings, and audio settings. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	Currently in development is creating a character selection system that persist between selections when loading to the server session and traveling. From there I also need to fix how these characters are replicated between the server and client. </p>

                        <p>During my fall semester of 2024 I wanted to do as many game jams. Attached to the button is a link to my Itch page of all the games I have playable throughout my college career. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The game jams have given me the opportunity to test my problem solving skills without being given the answer. A lot of my time in game development had been stuck looking at courses and tutorials for Unreal or Unity so being able to prove I can operate indepedently from those systems is very self-fulfilling. </p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>I have also at this point started using github much more on my personal projects to track commits to track how much I work and to be able to share solutions to problems so people don't have to spend hours like I did trying to solve a problem that consist of one line of hidden code. </p>

                        <h3>Unreal Consulting (UE 5 C++)</h3>
                        <p> During my winter break of my senior year of college I decided I would get a certificate in Unreal C++ development. I wanted to prove to myself that if a client of mine wanted a particular game developed I would be able to complete the request in a timely manner and also use strong S.O.L.I.D principles for system development. I reached out to a handful of collegeues who agreed to design game ideas and create art/music assets. In exchange I would develop their requests in Unreal using the C++ pipeline.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>Over the span of the spring semester of 2023 I developed: </p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>●	A 1st person platforming game where the main character can wall run, teleport, and double jump. A checkpoint system setup. Since this project was made for an audio engineer, I developed the system to expansable from a blueprints approach so that my team member can easily work in tandum with me without needing to be overwhelmed by looking at all the code.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	A 3rd person FPS which replicates the throwing mechanic from the game "Control". This project was used to help me understand how to develop a C++ for a colleague whos main focus was on VFX systems.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	A 2.5D puzzle game where you utilize roots to connect other fungal colonies while traversing through the world's terrain. This project was espcially challenging since I had to override Unreal's default spline system to work as a modular component that would allow the artist to pass in their own assets and would use these assets to regenerate roots at runtime. 
                        </p>

                        <p>●	A dynamic room system which allowed scenes to be additively loaded in and out upon entering/exiting entry points, with the objective of allowing designers to be able to work on multiply scenes at the same time and reduce computation of loading unneccessary scenes. </p>

                        <p>During my junior year of college, I took a class that focused on the development of common game engine systems using C++ and HLSL. The class really helped me understand the many systens underneath most game engines. Over the course of the entire class I worked on one primary project where I developed: </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>●	A game engine that took in .fbx files and parsed that data into points for the computer to calculate out triangles and visualize the object.</p>
                        <p>●	A simple render pipeline that took in HLSL data, materials, shaders, textures, normals, and light maps. Using the feed in data it would apply these desired changeds onto a specific mesh.</p>
                        <p>●	A game object system that would allow meshes to have transforms and translation which could be updated at runtime.</p>
                        <p>●	A camera system to utilized culling for optimization. Contained movement and rotation, allowing the user to fully view 3D objects.</p>
                        <p>●	A light system to allow for interaction with spot lights, directional lights, spot lights, diffusion, and specular data.</p>

                        <p>Shrine of Radiance is Unreal Engine Blueprints project I developed over my winter break of my Junior year of college based off the online course "Game Dev Unlocked". The course helped me develop a baseline understanding of Unreal Engine's main systems. I decided to use this project during my spring semester for my composing for video games class. The results I got from the project were:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	A simple first person puzzle game where the player had to bounce around lasers to hit goals and move onto new levels.</p>
                        <p>●	Over 10 puzzle areas designed using nanite assets for the quixel bridge marketplace.</p>
                        <p>●	A dynamic music system that changed based off progress into the game using metasounds.</p>

                        <h3>Peace of Mind (Unity)</h3>
                        <p>Peace of mind is a walking-sim where you activate generators to escape society. I created the project during the summer of my softmore year of college, which was based off the online course "Game Dev Unlocked". I used the concepts learned from this project to demonstrate my understanding of Unity and secure my first job in the game dev industry. What I accomplished was:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	Created a open world level experience using assets from the Unity Marketplace.</p>
                        <p>●	Used built in Unity tools: terrain generation, foliage system, post-processing, lighting, VFX, etc. to enhance the visuals of the world.</p>
                        <p>●	Created and editted art assets in photoshop and blender/maya.</p>
                        <p>●	Created voice-over clips in audacity and adobe audition.</p>

                        <p>Curly Brackets is a school group project that was developed my spring semester of my freshman year of college. The game is a tower defense that has an external tool to develop maps and enemy waves outside of the main project. Amongst my collegeues I developed: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	The tower interactions and upgrade paths.</p>

                        <p>●	The data parser which takes information from the external tool to create levels.</p>

                        <p>I decided that would take a leap year during my college career to focus on sharpening my skills in game development. During this period I landed a job offer from iDTech to teach the Unreal Engine classes at MIT for the summer. I worked 70+ hours a week, assisting over 180 students in the tech camp and overnight academy program. Over the summer I was able to help by: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>●	Teaching students how to utilize Unreal Engines blueprint system to develop gameplay mechanics.</p>
                        <p>●	Many students would request material outside the planned curriculum so I would create my own material to teach Unreal Engines behavior tree AI system, the C++ pipeline in Unreal Engine, low-level shader concepts for materials, and linear algebra concepts.</p>
                        <p>●	I handled assisting in the supervision of the students during lectures, meal times, activity periods, and class trips.</p>
                        <p>●	During the spring of 2024 I now teach fully online, developing two projects to teach concepts in Unity and Unreal.</p>
