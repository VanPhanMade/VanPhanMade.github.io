3 files for the new website (index.html, portfolio.js, style.css) are at the root of this folder. 

Other folders are the original folders for the old website. Maybe let's delete them?

However, I did continue to use media folder and created a new folder called portfolioMedia to store all the videos.

And I just realized I didn't get to put resume on the new website yet...there are still a lot of things we can do to improve, stay tuned~^
